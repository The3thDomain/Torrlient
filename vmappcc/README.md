# VMapp Computing Center
Was inspired by the VMapps used by the BOINC Distributed Computing Project. 
But inastead of distributing them to serval volunteers, they are distributed internally.

This project can be found at https://vmappcc.torrlient.com

## Planned Features
- Ability to upload only disk
- Ability to upload only code (vm-code, in dev)
